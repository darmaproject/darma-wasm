Darma Cash Project WASM (Darma-WASM)
=====

The Darma-WASM is a [WebAssembly](http://webassembly.org)-based interpreter,Forked from [wagon](https://github.com/go-interpreter/wagon).It is an important part of DVM.

**NOTE:** `Darma-WASM` requires `Go >= 1.9.x`.

The Darma Virtual Machine (DVM) is a powerful, sandboxed virtual stack embedded within each full Darma node, responsible for executing contract bytecode. Contracts are typically written in higher level languages, like C/C++, Go, Python, Rust, then compiled to WASM bytecode.
